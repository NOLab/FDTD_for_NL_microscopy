# FDTD_for_NL_microscopy

This repository hosts the different codes used to generate the simulations for the article "Modeling nonlinear microscopy nearindex-mismatched interfaces"
There is a ombination of Matlab code  (THG with green's function, 2PEF with angular spectrum) & Lumerical scripts (THG and 2PEF using FDTD)
